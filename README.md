## üîç Project Overview

- **Objective:** Build a machine learning classifier that predicts a binary outcome (`y`) from 60 input features (`x1` to `x60`) with a strong F1 score.
- **Approach:** Test and compare different classification algorithms, optimize hyperparameters, and select the best-performing model based on F1.
- **Output:** A single-column `.csv` file of predicted labels (0s and 1s) for unseen test data.
